This is a Wordpress theme built from scratch , I built this project to learn the wordpress theme development.

What i learned during this project ?

- **Theme Setup:**
  - Organized theme file structure.
  - Implemented theme support for navigation menus, post thumbnails, post formats, custom logos, and custom backgrounds.

- **Templates and Pages:**
  - Utilized WordPress template hierarchy for various page templates (front page, single post, archive, category, 404, etc.).
  - Used template parts and template tags to ensure modular and reusable code.

- **Functionalities:**
  - Implemented the WordPress Loop and multiple loops with resetting.
  - Created and registered sidebars and custom widgets using the Widget API.
  - Registered metaboxes and secured form data with nonces.
  - Used conditional tags and excerpts, with custom logic for handling "read more" links and excerpt truncation.

- **Development Tools and Practices:**
  - Used Babel for JavaScript compatibility with modern browsers.
  - Utilized Sass for CSS pre-processing.
  - Employed Webpack to bundle CSS and JS files.
  - Followed object-oriented programming principles and used the Singleton pattern.

- **User Roles and Capabilities:**
  - Managed user capabilities and created custom admin roles to control access to theme features.
